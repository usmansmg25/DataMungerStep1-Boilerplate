## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 1 - Database Engine Assignment

### Problem Statement

As an initial step of building a Utility to get meaningful information out of our Raw data - **as a first step you should be able to parse (decipher) our question. 
In our computing terms, we call this a query.**Our system should be able to interpret this and break it into several parts - so that necessary actions can be triggered to fetch the required information in the proper format.

### STEP 1 - Deciphering the parts of the String (Query)

Please note that the End User interacting with this utility will give out **SQL** like instructions and would expect the system to respond with necessary information. The system perceives this as a
String of characters and we should manipulate and break this string into appropriate Data Structures. For Instance,

Query: **SELECT winner, Count( winner ) FROM ipl.csv WHERE win_by_runs > 100 GROUP BY winner ORDER BY winner;**

Sample Data: 

|    winner                   |Count(winner)|
|:----------------------------|------------:|
|Kings XI Punjab              |   1         |     
|Kolkata Knight Riders        |   1         |
|Rajasthan Royals             |   1         |
|Royal Challengers Bangalore  |   3         |


Query: **SELECT city, winner FROM ipl.csv WHERE winner='Chennai Super Kings' AND city ='Abu Dhabi' AND season=2014;**

Sample Data: 

|    city      |  winner            |
|:-------------|-------------------:|
|Abu Dhabi     | Chennai Super Kings|

-----------
Few terms need to understand before starting the project.

    1.select -> get the required information

    2.'*' -> select all the fields 

    3.where -> filter result

    4.order by -> sort the result based on particular field

    5.group by -> get the records together based on the particular field.

    6.aggregate -> There are 5 aggregates,they are "sum,count,min,max,avg".  

    7.Example query string : select season,winner,player_match from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore';

        a.fetching season, winner, player_match 

        b.from the file ipl.csv (csv -> Comma Separated Value)

        c.where - filter the results. Get the details of the matches played in Bangalore after season 2014
        
        d.ipl.csv - a name of the file from which we need to fetch the information/records

-----------

## Our STEP 1 involves three tasks, given below:

1) Write a program to read the query string as input and split them into words. Print the output on the console as given below:

    Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore'
    
    Output String: select
    			    	 * 
    			     from 
    			     ipl.csv  
    			     where  
    			     season
    			     > 
    			     2014
    			     and 
    			     city
    			     =
    			     'bangalore'

2) Further, enhance your program to now extract certain parts of the same query:

	i. Get only file name from the query string.
	
		Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore'
		Output String : ipl.csv
	
3) Get only base part(before `where` word) of the query from the given query string. 

		Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore'
		Output String : select * from ipl.csv 

After all the logic is written for these methods run DataMungerTestTask1.java file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our STEP II involves three tasks, given below:

1)Extract the selected fields/information from the given query.

     Input String : select city,winner,player_match from ipl.csv where season > 2014 
                    and city = 'Bangalore'
	Output String :	city
            			winner
            			player_match


2)Get only filter part(after `where` word before'group by or order by' if they exist in the query) of the query from the given query string. 
	
		Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore'
		Output String : season > 2014 and city ='bangalore'
		
		Input String : select city from ipl.csv where season > 2014 or city = 'Bangalore'
		               order by city
		Output String : season > 2014 or city = 'bangalore


3) As there will be multiple conditions, separate each condition and display in the different line.
	    
	    Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city = 'Bangalore'
		Output String : season > 2014 
                         city ='bangalore'
                         

After all the logic is written for these methods run DataMungerTestTask2.java file.   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
##Our STEP III involves two tasks, given below:            
		               
1)Extract the logical operators in sequence from the given query string. 
  Note: Logical operators are "and, or, not"
	    
	 Input String : select season,winner,player_match from ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city ='Bangalore' or date > '31-12-2014'
	    Output String : 
		               and
		               or
		        
2)Extract the order by field from the given string.
  Note : The user may need the information in sorted order of a particular field.
        
     Input String : select * from ipl.csv where season > 2016 and city= 'Bangalore' order by win_by_runs
	Output String : win_by_runs

After all the logic is written for these methods run DataMungerTestTask3.java file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

##Our STEP IV involves two tasks, given below:  

1)Extract the group by field from the given string.
   Note : The user may need the related information grouped together.
   For Example they may require to see the information department wise.
        
        Input String : select team1, city from ipl.csv where season > 2016 and city='Bangalore' group by team1
		Output String : team1
	
2) User may require the information like who is getting maximum salary or minimum age etc.. these are called aggregate functions (minimum, maximum, count, average, sum)
	
	Input String : select avg(win_by_wickets),min(win_by_runs) from ipl.csv 
	Output String : 
		            avg(win_by_wickets)
                     min(win_by_runs)
	            
	   	Note:  Other parts like where clause, order by, group by may be present in the query.

After all the logic is written for these methods run DataMungerTestTask4.java file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of all the methods Implementation is done run DataMungertest.java file.  	   	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expected solution

Displaying various **components/parts** of the query like **selected fields, conditional parts, aggregate fields, groupBy field, OrderBy field**

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step1** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_java_datamunging/DataMungerStep1_Boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step1`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step1 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step1`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step1` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step1.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
